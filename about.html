            Born in the Islamic Center at NYU, Aftab is also a publication that serves 
            as an outlet for cultural, spiritual, and self-expressive pieces made by 
            students and community members. Similar to its namesake, which signifies 
            sunlight in Farsi, Aftab sheds light on the work of artists, poets, photographers, 
            and writers that may find themselves without a garden for their work to flourish in.
